# WebScraping
Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. 
It involves making HTTP requests to a website's server, downloading the HTML of the web page, and then parsing that HTML to extract the data you need.
It can be useful for a wide range of applications, such as data mining, data analysis, and automated testing.
